## Gather User Insights

Collect && centralize user-specific details. Technical details, dev tooling, timelines - these things are not relevant when gathering goals for the user experience.

- Collect relevant user personas
- Collect user stories
- Refine User Stories with a team Product Owner
- **In a heavily data-driven application,** collect some data that is relevant to UI/UX being developed

### Artifacts && Success

- Clear User Stories are understood by the UX-UI folks. The user stories can be related to existing functionality as a way of assuring the user storeis integrate into the application
- Relevant example data are collected. More detailed designs leverage 1 or more pieces of example data for 'real' implementation examples of the detailed execution.

## Shape the User Workflow

Once expected user-stories are collected, a general workflow can be built. 'Stages' of the ui can be laid out, highlighting navigational efforts. User-friendly text should be displayed alongside thumbnails, clearly connecting user stories to each UI element, each page, each laid-out element.

- Illustrate multiple user scenarios for using the new feature, the new page, the new detail
- In 'broad strokes', show user-friendly language along side thumbnail diagrams, explaining the goals, expectations, and intentions of each UI element, of each 'stage' along expected user journeys
-

### Artifacts && Success

- Thumbnail sketches are gathered, presented, and approved by stakeholders && relevant scrum team members
- User-Friendly explanatory text is present and understoon for each 'big picture' UI detail - pages, components, sections, etc

## Design Wireframes

Once the user workflows are clear & agreed upon, wireframes can make clear the UI elements that allow a user journey to occur. Explanatory text can be helpful explaining UI element details. Inlcuded in wireframes can be -

- navigation style(s)
- buttons && interactions
- execution of user-choice options & results
- text explaining element options, routing concerns, edge-cases
- **In a heavily data-driven application,** annotations can allude to data-driven elements that will vary by data

### Artifacts && Success

- wireframe diagrams are developed, highlighting UI details particular to the user stories
- annotations are present where appropriate, highlighting user choices, navigational efforts, and elements
- choices about the application are made and agreed upon: navigation, layouts, user-flow expectations, etc.

## Craft Higher Fidelity Implementation Expectations

Once wireframes are collected, and the use-cases of users is clear, fully-integrated designs are ready for design efforts. Design-system elements replace wireframed concepts. Detailed styles are introduced to the designs. - **In a heavily data-driven application,** varying element states are clear and annotated.
