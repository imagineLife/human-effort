## Gather User Insights

Collect && centralize user-specific details. Technical details, dev tooling, timelines - these things are not relevant when gathering goals for the user experience.

- Collect relevant user personas
- Collect user stories
- Refine User Stories with a team Product Owner
- **In a heavily data-driven application,** collect some data that is relevant to UI/UX being developed

### Artifacts

- User Stories
- Data the UI will show

## Shape the User Workflow

Once expected user-stories are collected, a general workflow can be built. 'Stages' of the ui can be laid out, highlighting navigational efforts. User-friendly text should be displayed alongside thumbnails, clearly connecting user stories to each UI element, each page, each laid-out element.

- Illustrate multiple user scenarios for using the new feature, the new page, the new detail
- In 'broad strokes', show user-friendly language along side thumbnail diagrams, explaining the goals, expectations, and intentions of each UI element, of each 'stage' along expected user journeys
-

### Artifacts

- Thumbnail sketches
- User-Friendly explanatory text for each 'big picture' page, component, section, and user moment
