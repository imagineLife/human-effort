## Succeeding Through Personality

### A Process

**A Gap In Success**  
Success can be described by a set of tasks accomplished, a series of goals achieved, a "pick yourself up by the bootstraps" approach to life - this does not make sense for everyone. Certainly in America, it does seem highly valued to be able to identify and achieve steps toward goals, but there are lots of folks who experience life, work, relationships and influence beyond achieving goals.  
When success applies only to goal-setters, those who do not fit this mold can be left in the dust for no good reason.

**A Path of Success through Personality**  
Personality can help clarify 'success' for the parts of our lives that do not seem to fit perfectly in a goal-oriented paradigm. Figuring out ways of understanding, working with, and embracing unique and individual personalities can help identify what 'success' can look like.

#### Some Tooling of Personality

There are an abundance of personality tools. There are assessments. There is counseling. There are seminars, books, courses, fields of study - there's a lot of material on the topics of personality.  
There are lots of tools, and I've found these tools to be helpful -

- [Meyers Briggs](https://www.myersbriggs.org/my-mbti-personality-type/mbti-basics/)
  - There's also the [16Personalities](https://www.16personalities.com/free-personality-test), which has a friendly cartoonish approach to explaining myers briggs && more. INTJ.
- [StrengthsFinder](https://www.gallup.com/cliftonstrengths/en/253676/how-cliftonstrengths-works.aspx)
  - This is perhaps the most influential personality tool I've stumbled up.

  - Author, speaker, activist, and mentor Mark Scandrette enlightened me to ways of living where poetry and pragmatism are inseperable. Themes have forever impacted the way I experience the world -
    - Our identity as individuals is contemplated
    - An unshakable purpose can fuel our choices
    - We can learn to live open-handedly, giving generously and accepting unabashedly
    - We can approach all of life as committed contributors rather than passive consumers
    - Feedom & Peace can come while enduring the divided world we live in
