## What is a difficult convo?
- Anything I might find hard to talk about  
- Something where the situation leads me to fear the consequence

## To Address, or not to address  
**AVOIDING** might leave me...
- feel taken advantage of  
- feel like I have pent-up concerns over time
- feel like I miss out on something
- feel like I am dividing or being divided from others
- feel like something won't get accomplished or addressed otherwise  


**CONFRONTING** might...
- make things worse
- make me realize that I made a mountain out of a molehill
- leade me to be rejected
- lead me to be hurt  

## A Common Structure to Difficult Convos  
### The 'What Happened' Convo
- a disagreement about 'what happened'  
- addressing TRUTH, INTENTIONS && BLAME
- Truth
  - someone (_me_) is right, someone (_you_) are wrong
  - **The truth about the truth** is that these convos aren't _only_ about discovering the truth. Difficult convos deal with conflicting understanding, different values, different approaches
  - **try to move away from the right/wrong convo** and toward **perception, expressing my own understandings, naming what is important to me**  
- Intention
  - what were your intentions, what are my intentions
  - **wrongly**, I assume i know, and understand the intentions of the other
  - **wrongly** I might assume the other has bad intentions
  - **Intentions are invisible**

- Blaming
  - **wrongly** I might focus on blaming the other
  - **How we got here is due to both parties**, in some way
  - Focus on...
    - **understanding** how we got here
    - the cause of the problem outside the scope of blame

### The 'Feelings' Convo
- **what do we do with our emotions?**
- asking && answering questions about feelings
  - are my feelings... 
    - valid
  	- appropriate
	- should I acknowledge my feelings
	- should I deal with the facts instead of my feelings
- **Review Emotional Intelligence**

## The 'Identity' Convo
- **"What does this say about me?"**  
- internal to ourselves
- "what does this moment really mean to me"
	- what is the impact on the relationship
	- my self-worth might be on the line

## Move Toward a Convo about Learning
- Appreciate these complexities
  - perceptions
  - intentions
  - joint contributions
  - the role of feelings
-
