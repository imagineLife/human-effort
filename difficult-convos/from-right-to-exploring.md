## Why We See the world uniquely
### We take in information
- we might have _different information than the other person_
- we might _notice_ different things
- we might have different hopes, dreams, & fears
### We interpret what we take in
- We are influenced by past experiences
- We _APPLY DIFFERENT IMPLICIT RULES_ to ourselves, our situation, and the other
- When rules collide, the situation can get complicated
  - "It is unprofessional to be late"
  - "This will not escalate, no matter what"
  - "This person has to talk && be clear about what they are thinking, &&/or what they want"
- There is nothing wrong with these rules
  - **In conflict, thought, Identifying these rules  between myself and the other can help clear the complication**
### We draw conclusions about what is happening
- our conclusions often reflect our self-interest
- **example**
  - professor howard Raiffa of Harvard business school ran an experiemnt
    - 1 team was 'selling' company xyz
    - 1 team was 'buying' company xyz
    - Howard told each team to VALUE the company
      - sellers valued 30% higher than market value
      - buyers valued 30% lower than market value
