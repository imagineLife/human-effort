# Culture for Remote Teams
- what language is spoken at work?
- what are the preferred work hours?
- How is contenxtual info shared?
- Burnout and overwork are more common remotely
- Time-off is more important


## Culture Can Support the Business Strategy
- Connect culture to business goals
- Update cultural practices to support remote work
- Document the culture

## Create a system of values
- expect to "unnlearn" old beliefs
  - just as important for learning new things
- Put a focus on...
  - creating trust
  - creating permission for team members to drop old behaviors and try new ones
- ensure that **psychological safety is prioritized**
  - this should not erode
  - a big risk is to lose the values that bind us
