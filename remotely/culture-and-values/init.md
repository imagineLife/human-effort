## What is Culture
Harvard Business Review says...  
Strategy and culture are among the primary levers at top leaders' disposal in their never- ending quest to maintain organizational viability and effectiveness. 

"Strategy is a formal logical system for reaching your organization's goals. Culture is a system of values and beliefs which guides people to act in certain ways, through establishing norms and shared assumptions"

"Culture eats strategy for breakfast" - _Peter Drucker_
