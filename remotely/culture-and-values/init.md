# Culture
In-office:
- casual days
- swagger
- food
- meetings

... remotely, these are gone :/

## What is Culture
Harvard Business Review says...  
Strategy and culture are among the primary levers at top leaders' disposal in their never- ending quest to maintain organizational viability and effectiveness. 

"Strategy is a formal logical system for reaching your organization's goals. Culture is a system of values and beliefs which guides people to act in certain ways, through establishing norms and shared assumptions"

"Culture eats strategy for breakfast" - _Peter Drucker_

  - team members understanding how their actions can uphold the value
  - answering team member questions about what actions are expected of them in any given situation
  - a pattern of self-perpetuating behaviors && re-inforcement of values
  - a continuity of action && interaction that persists throughout the company
  - builds "_strong company culture_" through practices and expectations

## Other Orgs Values
- [Automattic's Creed](https://automattic.com/creed/)
  - I will never stop learning. I won’t just work on things that are assigned to me. I know there’s no such thing as a status quo. I will build our business sustainably through passionate and loyal customers. I will never pass up an opportunity to help out a colleague, and I’ll remember the days before I knew everything. I am more motivated by impact than money, and I know that Open Source is one of the most powerful ideas of our generation. I will communicate as much as possible, because it’s the oxygen of a distributed company. I am in a marathon, not a sprint, and no matter how far away the goal is, the only way to get there is by putting one foot in front of another every day. Given time, there is no problem that’s insurmountable.
