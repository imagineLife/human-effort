# Culture
In-office:
- casual days
- swagger
- food
- meetings

## What is Culture
Harvard Business Review says...  
Strategy and culture are among the primary levers at top leaders' disposal in their never- ending quest to maintain organizational viability and effectiveness. 

"Strategy is a formal logical system for reaching your organization's goals. Culture is a system of values and beliefs which guides people to act in certain ways, through establishing norms and shared assumptions"

"Culture eats strategy for breakfast" - _Peter Drucker_

### Notes
- an effective value results in...
  - team members understanding the value
  - team members understanding how their actions can uphold the value
  - answering team member questions about what actions are expected of them in any given situation
  - a pattern of self-perpetuating behaviors && re-inforcement of values
  - a continuity of action && interaction that persists throughout the company
  - builds "_strong company culture_" through practices and expectations
