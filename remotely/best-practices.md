# Being Ready For Remote

## Create a Transition Plan

Consider...

- company size
- number of company offices
- who && how many already work remote in the company
- what tooling is involved for handling, managing, tracking, && interacting with remote folks
- how communication happens in the organization
- how 'career mapping' happens

## Create a Remote Leadership Team

- experts in remote work
- make clear any remote difficulties: collaboration, communication, onboarding, naming expectations
- **Start at the top**, consider having the executive team work remotely

## Develop the remote-empowering infrastructure

- tooling
- I.D any **gaps** that may need addressing when moving from in-house to remote
- I.D Communication breakdowns that might happen
- any new tools needed?

## Develop a Handbook

- introduce transparent expectations across the org
- **maybe particular to working remote**
- perhaps **start** as a single page
- allow member-updatability, collaborative editing
- leverage version-tracking
- keep it up-to-date
- take docs seriously

## Establish a Communication Plan

- talk to HR
- be transparent, don't hold back - leaders should prioritize communication
- communicate consistency
  - people will respond differently to a change

## Encourage Informal Communication

## Drive Change

- change can be difficult
- prepare for a gradual process
- celebrate successful small changes
