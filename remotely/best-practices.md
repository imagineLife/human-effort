# Being Ready For Remote

## Create a Transition Plan

Consider...

- company size
- number of company offices
- who && how many already work remote in the company
- what tooling is involved for handling, managing, tracking, && interacting with remote folks
- how communication happens in the organization
- how 'career mapping' happens

## Create a Remote Leadership Team

- experts in remote work
- make clear any remote difficulties: collaboration, communication, onboarding, naming expectations
- **Start at the top**, consider having the executive team work remotely
