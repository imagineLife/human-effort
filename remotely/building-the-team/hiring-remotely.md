## Work With Remote Recruiters

## What to look for

- who have experience hiring for remote roles
- instead of CULTURE fit, focus on VALUES
  - develop strong company values
  - discuss values with the candidate
  - INSTEAD of looking for a good 'personality match', look for folks who **resonate with team values**
- new folks **shouldn't be fitting in**: they **should be adding to the culture**

## Should the Candidate have remote experience

- not necessarily
- could have had bad practices in previous remote
- look for...
  - people who can work independantly
  - with autonomy
  - show history of **self-motivation**
  - starting,leading + completing projects with little direction
- **AVOID**
  - people who don't need micro-management
  - micro-managers
  - people comfortable with iteration

## Interview Format

- avoid a 'panel'
  - its awkward for the interview-ee
- stick to 1-on-1 interviews
  - over video calls preferrably
- ensure everyone is well-prepared
