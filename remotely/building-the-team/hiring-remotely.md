# Hiring For Remote Work

...after 'Hiring'

## Work With Remote Recruiters

- who have experience hiring for remote roles
- instead of CULTURE fit, focus on VALUES
  - develop strong company values
  - discuss values with the candidate
  - INSTEAD of looking for a good 'personality match', look for folks who **resonate with team values**
- new folks **shouldn't be fitting in**: they **should be adding to the culture**
