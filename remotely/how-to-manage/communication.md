# Communication is Crucial
- It is the biggest challenge
  - remote, it is amplified

## Async Communication 
https://learn.gitlab.com/coursera-remote-work/asynchronous-comms
- Develop good practices

Good async allows...
- multiple time-zone inclusion
- less meetings
- flexible scheduling
- raising morale
- raising productivity


## GitLab Async Communication Policy
"... after two async check-ins on a topic or task, call a meeting to discuss it further. When the issue is clearly understood, the process can continue asynchronously"

### Iteration
https://learn.gitlab.com/coursera-remote-work/values-1
- Foster "Progress over perfection"
- "...we do the smallest thing possible and get it out as quickly as possible"
  - If we make suggestions that can be excluded from the first iteration, turn them into a separate linked Issue
  - "We will know how to better proceed when _something is released_"
  - goes against "get it right" mentality


```text
  write down... 
    - only what you can do with the time you have for this project right now
      - That might be 5 minutes or 2 hours worth of time 
    - Think of what you can complete in that time that would improve the current situation
Iteration can be uncomfortable, even painful.  
If you're doing iteration correctly, it should be.
```
- Perfectionism is an impediment
- If you're only working on a sinlge project, async can feel taxing and inefficient
- **work on a few things**
  - tag someone on item 1 when blocked
  - begin item 2
- 

### Documentation and Transparency
https://learn.gitlab.com/coursera-remote-work/handbook-first-doc
- make a single source of truth for docs
- "GitLabâ€™s handbook is our single source of truth for all processes and stable information."
- Adopt a Documentation-First approach
- In an early-stage company...
  - Its tempting to avoid a documenting strategy
  - Meetings work for sharing information
  - 



## Cross-Cultural
- can cause complication

## Feeling Excluded

## GitLab's approach
- transparency
- leave room for informal communication
- document all things
- assume positive intent
