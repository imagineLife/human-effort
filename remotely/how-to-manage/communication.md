# Communication is Crucial
- It is the biggest challenge
  - remote, it is amplified

## Async Communication 
https://learn.gitlab.com/coursera-remote-work/asynchronous-comms
- Develop good practices

Good async allows...
- multiple time-zone inclusion
- less meetings
- flexible scheduling
- raising morale
- raising productivity


## GitLab Async Communication Policies
### Make a meeting after missed check-ins  
"... after two async check-ins on a topic or task, call a meeting to discuss it further. When the issue is clearly understood, the process can continue asynchronously"

### Require Meetings to have written agendas
"...GitLab requires every meeting to have a written agenda, and we allow people to RSVP “no” or stop participating if the meeting isn’t relevant or valuable to their work"

### Keep Messenger Text && Docs Separate
"We also set our Slack messages to automatically expire after 90 days, ensuring that any work discussions that people need to preserve will be moved to the single source of truth"

### Leverage Sync for what it is best at
https://learn.gitlab.com/coursera-remote-work/informal-communicati
"...encourage the use of synchronous communication for what it’s best at: informal, social connection." 
- No experience can replace a casual conversation
- without the ability to connect on a personal level, your team can become lonely or burned out
- Use Slack and video calls for...
  - coffee chats, 
  - sharing wins, 
  - giving praise and thanks
  - connecting over personal interests
-  these tools can add to your team experience rather than impeding it


### Async Challenges
- Providing Context
  - https://learn.gitlab.com/coursera-remote-work/effective-communicat-1
  - when INSTRUCTIONS are complete, several communication cycles are needed to clarify reqs
- Lack of in-person connection
  - async communication is mostly written
  - can lead to mis-understandings && hurt feelings
  - ENCOURAGE PEOPLE to...
    - assume the best
    - use informal chats

#### Leverage Low-Context Communication
- provide full information and additional references or resources, so that the recipient of your message can effectively act on it
- This should be part of manager and employee training

### Iteration
https://learn.gitlab.com/coursera-remote-work/values-1
- Foster "Progress over perfection"
- "...we do the smallest thing possible and get it out as quickly as possible"
  - If we make suggestions that can be excluded from the first iteration, turn them into a separate linked Issue
  - "We will know how to better proceed when _something is released_"
  - goes against "get it right" mentality


```text
  write down... 
    - only what you can do with the time you have for this project right now
      - That might be 5 minutes or 2 hours worth of time 
    - Think of what you can complete in that time that would improve the current situation
Iteration can be uncomfortable, even painful.  
If you're doing iteration correctly, it should be.
```
- Perfectionism is an impediment
- If you're only working on a sinlge project, async can feel taxing and inefficient
- **work on a few things**
  - tag someone on item 1 when blocked
  - begin item 2
- 

### Documentation and Transparency
https://learn.gitlab.com/coursera-remote-work/handbook-first-doc
- make a single source of truth for docs
- "GitLab’s handbook is our single source of truth for all processes and stable information."
- Adopt a Documentation-First approach
- In an early-stage company...
  - Its tempting to avoid a documenting strategy
  - Meetings work for sharing information
  - 



## Cross-Cultural
- can cause complication

## Feeling Excluded

## GitLab's approach
- transparency
- leave room for informal communication
- document all things
- assume positive intent
