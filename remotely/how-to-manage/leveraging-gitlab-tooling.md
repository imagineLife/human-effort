## Epics, Issues, and Tasks
### Epics
- similar to a 'project'
- may take MONTHS to Complete

### Issues
- single piece of work within an epic
- might take a week-or-two to complete
- can be assigned...
  - to a single person to oversee the work
    - the "DRI", Directly Responsible Individual
- Small enough to know when 'done' happens
- big enough they don't take a lot of administration to maintain

### Tasks
- usually do-able in a day, maybe two
- can be done by a single person
