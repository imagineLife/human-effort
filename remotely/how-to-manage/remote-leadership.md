# Remote Leadership

1. Walk the Walk
2. Talk the Talk
3. Something else

I.E. Take a vacation. Show the people that it is ok to take a vacation

## Detect Burnout

- hard to do in remote env
- coach employees to manage their own time

## Focus on Async work

- Employees need to be able to work on their own
- People need to work, && come back to the team with progress that is READY!
- When async stops working...
  - gotta have an 'expensive' collab zoom-type meeting

## Skip the Monitoring

- people seem to work HARDER from home
- people might need coaching to STOP working so hard

## Reasonable Actions

- Multi-modal communication
  - say it 3x in 3 different ways
  - work hard at this! you've probabaly only reached 80% of people
- Assure employees are investing in their work space
  - comfortable
  - productive
  - its a business expense
  - good lighting
  - maybe somewhere outside the home when suitable
- Documentation Culture
  - Get artifacts
- Hybrid-Remote is a 'danger zone'
  - its actually MORE DIFFICULT than all-remote
  - conference rooms sound bad for those on video
  - IF HYBRID...
    - treat calls as all-remote
    - using their own head-sets
