# How To Do Meetings
## Every Meeting Must Have an Agenda
- Prevents knowledge leaks
- creates a searchable record of the discussion
- makes meetings mroe inclusive
- creates a take-away

## Document The Meeting
- take comprehensive notes
- record the meeting
- Create a transcription when needed

## Respect Time
- Minimize schedule disruptions
  - after-meeting takes time too
- allow folks to spend time on their tasks
  - minimize disruptions
- use "speedy meetings"
  - leave time BETWEEN MEETINGS

## Allow Multi-Tasking During Meetings
- its ok
- each member manages their attention
- repetition is ok
  - don't shame people for asking for repetition
- Meetings can be skipped!
  - record it, allow others to watch if they want
- Cancel un-needed meetings
  - after their purpose has been met

## Avoid Hybrid Calls
- make EVERYONE "remote"
- even in the same room, make people use their equipment
- DEFAULT to a "FULLY-REMOTE" feel


## Minimize the Tool Stack
- get max value out of existing tools
-
