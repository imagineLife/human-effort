What used to be ephemeral and on a whiteboard became writtend down and stored._" - Julien Dollon, Director of Engineering at Oracle

  - Represents the end of a transition && a new beginning
  - Indicates serious-ness of remote approach
  - Replace office with co-working space
  - By the time the doors are shut, it could be practically already happened
  - Maybe a final ceremony, even remotely!
  - Maybe even a bonus, paid-for by savings of office expenses
