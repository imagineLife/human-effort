# A Transition Plan
## Steps:
- Maturity Assessment
- Executive Buy-In
  - Get Leadership to understand and agree with the reasons and plan for remote adaptation
  - Avoid defaulting to the hybrid-remote model: ail for remote-first or all-remote
  - Make executive team remote
  - "_If yuou want remote to work, start by cutting off the head. When the chief is remote, all of a sudden everybody is remote and everybody starts writing down everything. What used to be ephemeral and on a whiteboard became writtend down and stored._" - Julien Dollon, Director of Engineering at Oracle
