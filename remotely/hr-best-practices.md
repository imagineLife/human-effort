# Some Thoughts on HR Best Practices

## Transparency

- employees should be able to see how work happens
  - issues that are visible
- employees should be able to see how work is resolved
  - conversations are directed to open chat channels

**An Example**  
A Leader posting vaca schedule ++ delegationg work publicly...

- gives _all_ the knowledge of who to talk to in the mean-time
- encourages others to take time off

**Another Example**  
Someone looking for career advancement...

- should be able to access info re promotions
- observe who is being promoted
- observe _why_ someone is being promoted
