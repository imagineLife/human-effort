### Remote Work
Working remote is a mutual agreement.

#### Trust
Working remote seems to be an explicit agreement, highlighting trust between all parties involved - the _doers_ (developers, designers, qa folks) and the _facilitators_ (stakeholders, managaers, project managers etc).

#### Organizing Trust
Wether working remote or in an office, organizing trust is a vital part of work. Tooling ([Jira](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/service-desk), [Asana](https://asana.com/home?utm_expid=.n57WTrKyRuW7h0tX0Scgxw.1&utm_referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F),  [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/), etc) can be a source of trust between the _doers_ and the _facilitators_.
