## Doing More together

Together we can achieve more than we would individually.  
**Our goal** is not to talk about something, it is to get something done. Coordinate actions to acieve results. Talking is not getting the gig done.
**Coordinating action is the purpose of commitment.**

## Establish Integrity of My Word

- I can have grounds to hold THEM accountable if THEY can see that MY word is good, and when I have THEIR word
- Finish with a promise from them
  - then I can hold them accountable

## Ask

- they might not say yes
- get clarity
  - who promises to do what and when

3 Parts:

- summary of prev converstaion
  - "In order to..." name the ultimate goal being achieved
    - prepare a report
    - get a project started
- ASK
  - I ask that you do X by Y
    - clearly observable
    - meet me from 3-6pm
    - "help" is not clear
    - other 'social graces' are less clear
- Elicit an agreement
  - allow them to say no
  - "are you ok with that"
  - a GESTURE, inviting the other person to give a clear promise

## Acceptable Responses

- Yes, I promise
  - clean
  - it'd be great to get these most of the time!
- No, i will not
  - clean
  - MIGHT follow with 'ill try' or 'i can try'
- I Need Clarification
  - reasonable
  - discuss
  - get to a yes or no
- I need to get back to you
  - get a WHEN from them
    - when they talk to someone else?
    - Monday?
- Counter Offers
  - I can do X instead
    - different commitment

## The Second Yes

- Validate that they understand what it means to say yes
  - repeat the agreement parts
  - use the word PROMISE as an affirmation
    - "let me understand, i hear you promising that you'll....."
- If you can't do it, let me know
  - 90% of people won't follow-up if they can't do it

## Holding Them Accountable

There could be 2 'reasons'...

### Expectations were not effective

- miscommunication
- miscoordination

### Damaged Relationship

- I can not trust them

Hold them accountable to their word, more than their action.

### Steps

#### Assure they understood the commitment

- I understood that we agreed to xyz, did i get it right?

#### Make them aware they broke the commitment

- maybe simply ask what happened
- they can explain why they did not deliver
  - ## could be reasonable

#### Ask why they didnt communicate that they couldnt do it

- most folks clam up
- the only legitimate response seems like "I messed up"
- I.D the promis-problem, not the task problem
- depending on the freq. of this...
  - first time allow
  - when repeating,

## ReEstablish Trust

- what are we going to do now to fulfill the promise
- there has been a breakdown
- deliver has been jeapordized
