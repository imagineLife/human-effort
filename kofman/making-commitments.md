## Clarify Request

- clarify the ask
- I hear you asking me to do X by Y
- shows me taking initiative

### Example of Vague Requests

- client commitments could go well
- other things, internal commitments, get lost in the sauce
- organization could be lacking
- 'empty talk' could seem real

## Self-Reflect before committing

- am i willing
- am I ready
- my integrity is on the line

## On Integrity

- Do I understand what they are asking
  - what
  - by when
- Do I have the resources to get that done
  - make a mental plan
  - check calendar
  - COULD respond with "I need to check here"
- Do I WANT to do it!
  - able does not mean necessary
  - sometimes a temptation can lead to a fast, bad yes
- Prepare to fail
  - fail safe
  - if something happens that gets in the way, I will not let them down
  - track progress
    - know if it is going properly
    - have communication available when something might go wrong, things out of plan

## Report A Commitment at risk

"No Battle plan survives first contact with the enemy" - _Helmuth von Moltke the Elder_

- report risk of non-delivery to stakeholders

## Make an effective Apology

- "Call your creditor"
  - Call the person
  - apologize
    - this commitment isnt happening
  - explain what happened
    - not justify
    - this can help maintain trust
    - in a way that does NOT let them ask "why didnt you tell me this before"
  - Inquire about consequences to the person
    - The goal is not to MINIMIZE MY EFFOR
    - the goal is to MAINTAIN / MAXIMIZE TRUSTWORTHYNESS
    - "How can I help lessen the damage that will not / has been done"
  - Minimize the impact
    - re-commit
    - make another promise
    - take care of the creditor

## Building Trust when breaking a promise

- Treat the person like a creditor
- come up with an alternative
  - CANT?
  - ask them bout an alternative
- make it worth their while
  - you are a person
  - you deserve my word, my effort, and my time
  -
