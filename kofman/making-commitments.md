## Clarify Request

- clarify the ask
- I hear you asking me to do X by Y
- shows me taking initiative

### Example of Vague Requests

- client commitments could go well
- other things, internal commitments, get lost in the sauce
- organization could be lacking
- 'empty talk' could seem real

## Self-Reflect before committing

- am i willing
- am I ready
- my integrity is on the line

## On Integrity

- Do I understand what they are asking
  - what
  - by when
- Do I have the resources to get that done
  - make a mental plan
  - check calendar
  - COULD respond with "I need to check here"
- Do I WANT to do it!
  - able does not mean necessary
  - sometimes a temptation can lead to a fast, bad yes
- Prepare to fail
  - fail safe
  - if something happens that gets in the way, I will not let them down
  - track progress
    - know if it is going properly
    - have communication available when something might go wrong, things out of plan
  -
