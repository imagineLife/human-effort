**The Problem**
When things seem 'out of control'

**The solution**
I have the power to respond

## Victim mentality

- blame circumstances
- circumstances are only PART of the story
- maintaining innocence over responsibility
  - innocence depends on external factors being out of my control
- Complaining does bring people together, unfortunately
- What questions will reveal the wrongful victim?
  - what happened to you?
    - events
  - who wronged you?
    - persons
  - what should they have done instead?
    - victims have lots of answers
  - What should they do NOW?
    - victims have lots of answers
  - What punishment do they deserve?
    - this justifies a victims' potential 'mean'-ness
  - BUT
    - this is disabling to the victim, the person

## Moving to Response Ability

- I can do SOMETHING about the problem
- I am responsible for RESPONDING TO what happens to me, not responsible FOR what happens to me

## The Player Mentality

- see how my behavior influeces the outcome
- the player is "in the game" of the challenge
- dignity of the person depends on the person, not the circumstances
  - this DOESNT necessarily create success
  - it creates uncoditional integrity
