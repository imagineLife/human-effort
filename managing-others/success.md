## Managing Others

#### The Clarity of Coding

Coding for the web is significantly more 'black and white' than working with others. Coding has defined, agreed upon, written, established patterns of

- 'architecture' patterns: OOP, FP, Proceedural, etc
- testing, assuring that the code 'does what it should', including failure
- understood function of parts: HTML for content, CSS for styling, JS for interactive activity

Even when some of these details are not agreed upon amongst a team, concesus can be made. Teams can decide together:

- what tests should look like in their shared code-base
- how a rest-api i architected, how the endpoints are shaped, how the requests && responses are put together
- when to adopt new technology together - change DBs, re-consider beyond-the-team dependencies, etc
-

Working with others, managing engineers - the elements of this are not as defined, agreed upon, written or established. Books are regularly re-framing the work. Enginerring management methods are being framed and reframed. Scrum is out. Agile is outdated. Every team is unique. It depends on the person.
