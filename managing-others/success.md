## Managing Others

### The Clarity of Coding

Coding for the web is significantly more 'black and white' than working with others. Coding has defined, agreed upon, written, established patterns of

- 'architecture' patterns: OOP, FP, Proceedural, etc
- testing, assuring that the code 'does what it should', including failure
- understood function of parts: HTML for content, CSS for styling, JS for interactive activity

Even when some of these details are not agreed upon amongst a team, concesus can be made. Teams can decide together:

- what tests should look like in their shared code-base
- how a rest-api i architected, how the endpoints are shaped, how the requests && responses are put together
- when to adopt new technology together - change DBs, re-consider beyond-the-team dependencies, etc

### The Ambiguity of Working With Others

Working with others, managing engineers - the elements of this are not as defined, agreed upon, written or established.  
Books are regularly re-framing how we can relate to one another.  
Enginerring management methods are being framed and reframed.  
The Role is a Team Lead, or an Engineering Manager, or a Lead Full Stack Engineer.  
Scrum is the preffered managerial hammer of process.  
Agile is outdated.  
Every team is unique.  
It depends on the person.  
New roles are developing, old roles are irrelevant.

### Benefitting from an Engineering Manager as a Dev

A developer can benefit from an engineer. The Manager does not need to be overbearing, controlling, manipulative, self-serving, shallow, misinformed, untrustworthy.

### The Work of Managing Others

Some details can help lead make managing other to success -

- Know what success looks like for those being managed
  - Embrace an 'engineering ladder'
  - Quantify the current-status of engineers
  - Quantify practical next-steps, short-term goals and longer-term goals for each engineer
- Embrace methods for discovering & channeling engineers' strengths
  - focusing on strengths, for the engineer, will _feel_ better than correcting weaknesses
- Be their advocate
  - want success for each person on the team
