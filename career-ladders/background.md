# Background

### Grouping by 'Field'

A Common approach to career laddering is to accommodate several fields:

- engineering-focused
- 'management'/people-focused
- data-focused

## Notes

CircleCI:  
"We also decided on some key outcomes that the matrix should achieve. If we were to be successful, our matrix would adhere to the following attributes:

- **Consistency**. Competencies and the expectations for how to demonstrate them should be consistent within and across levels
- **Approachability**. Even without knowing all details of one level, it should be easy to develop an idea of the area of work and impact that engineers would be focusing on.
- **Simplicity**. The matrix should be sophisticated enough to honor the many factors of a successful career, and yet simple enough to be useful for meaningful career development conversations.
- **Clear language**. Word meanings should be precise and meaningful. Descriptors should be unambiguous and clearly denote shifts in frequency or scope of skills demonstrated. Competencies should utilize active language (“does” instead of “can do”), as it helps focus on activities instead of capabilities.
- **Straightforward structure**. We wanted to develop a structure that would allow people to see the big picture and dive into details as needed."
