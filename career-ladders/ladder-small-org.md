(_influenced by circle-ci's engineering ladder_)

Here, an in-process engineering ladder.

## Areas of Focus

- Technical Skills
  - code, testing, security, debugging, architecture
- Delivery

### Tech Specs

**Tech-specific ladder details** do not seem popular, as the tech is changing perhaps more-frequently than a persons' tenure in a given position.  
Tech-specifics can help put skin on how principles apply to the details of an engineers day.
