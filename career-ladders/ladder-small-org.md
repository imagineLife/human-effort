# A Small-Org Ladder

Here, a React+Node-focused engineering ladder.  
Tech-specific ladder details do not seem popular, as the tech is changing perhaps more-frequently than a persons' tenure in a given position.  
Tech-specifics can help put skin on how 'principles' apply to the details of an engineers day.
Here's an attempt -

| Category     | Junior Engineer                                                                                                                                                                                               | Engineer | Senior Engineer |
| :----------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | :------- | :-------------- |
| Testing      | Knows a testing pyramid <br> Writes Unit tests, sometimes with help from more senior engineers.                                                                                                               | -----    | -----           |
| Coding       | Writes Code that is testable, readable, considerate of edge cases, and errors. <br> Considers best-practices, sometimes with help from more senior engineers.                                                 | -----    | -----           |
| Architecting | Understands how the code being worked on fits in the the application, sometimes with help from more senior engineers. <br> Code Contributions are understood from more senior engineers.                      | -----    | -----           |
| React notes  | Tests props <br> Extends & Re-Uses Components <br> Understands but may not leverage all all available hooks <br> Regularly practices Component composition, creating state, passing state between components. | -----    | -----           |
| Node notes   | Leverages npm modules for server logic (_packages like express, bunyan,mocha_), sometimes with help from more senior engineers. <br> Regularly practices enahncing rest-api route logic.<br>                  | -----    | -----           |
