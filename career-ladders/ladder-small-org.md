  - Product Purpose Alignment, Team Strategy, Company Strategy
- Influencing
  - Decisions, Driving Team Alignment, Process Interactions,

### Tech Specs

**Tech-specific ladder details** do not seem popular, as the tech is changing perhaps more-frequently than a persons' tenure in a given position.  
Tech-specifics can help put skin on how principles apply to the details of an engineers day.
